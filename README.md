#Students Scores Table with Action Buttons

This is a 6-column students scores card
Made this project to improve my DOM manipulation skills by building a real world project.
Work done with HTML, CSS, and JS.
Learned to generate a table dynamically in JavaScript and how to send and access row data when clicking a button using JavaScript.
